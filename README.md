# Mac NodeJS Install

## Install Node Version Manager (NVM)

Node Version Manager (NVM) is a tool that will allow you to download and install
multiple versions of Node.js, one of the environments for the JavaScript
programming language that we teach at Flatiron School. Installing NVM is the
first step in installing Node.js on your macOS operating system.

## Install Node.js

For our JavaScript labs and lessons, we expect that students use Node.js on
their macOS operating system. If Node Version Manager (NVM) has been
successfully installed, you can quickly install Node.js with a couple of
commands.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `nvm install node` and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `nvm list` and press `<Enter>`
